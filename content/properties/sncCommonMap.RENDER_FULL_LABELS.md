Description: Render full labels on CIs on map. 
Applicable to all CI labels (CI name, host name, cluster label, etc.)
Enabling this will disable labels truncation, and labels will most probably overlap with other map elements.
Not applicable to network/storage path maps.
Default: disabled.

Value: `none`
