Description: A list of comma separated attachment mime types that do not render inline in the browser. This will prevent cross site scripting attacks. For example, text/html will force html files to be downloaded to the client as attachments rather than viewed inline in the browser.

Value: `application/xml,text/html,image/svg,image/svg+xml`
