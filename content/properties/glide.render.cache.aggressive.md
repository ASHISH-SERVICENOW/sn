title: "glide.render.cache.aggressive"
---

Description: Enable aggressive caching. If enabled, entries are removed from the render cache only when they expire from old age, rather than when their underlying data changes. Running in aggressive mode can significantly improve performance, but runs the risk of serving potentially 'stale' charts and graphs.

Value: `false`
